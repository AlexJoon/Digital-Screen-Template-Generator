## Troubleshooting

### My upload fails
- **Check file size** - Keep under 10MB
- **Verify file type** - Use PDF, Word, PowerPoint, or text
- **Try simpler format** - Convert complex files to PDF first

### Slides have wrong information
- **Review source document** - Ensure uploaded file has correct details
- **Use Event Details field** - Add corrections in the optional field
- **Regenerate** - Create new slides with corrected information

### Text is too small
- **Choose "Concise"** - Less text = larger fonts automatically
- **Simplify source** - Reduce amount of text in uploaded document
- **Highlight key info** - Put most important details in headers

### Images don't match event
- **Uncheck imagery option** - Generate text-only slides
- **Add event photos** - Include images in your source document
- **Regenerate** - Try again with different settings

### Process takes too long
- **Be patient** - Processing can take up to 2 minutes
- **Check connection** - Ensure stable internet
- **Don't close window** - Keep page open during generation
